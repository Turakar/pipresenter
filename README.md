# PiPresenter

## Overview
The PiPresenter is a mod for your Pi which adds the ability to easily show presentations from your USB-stick or your Moodle account.
The UI is displayed on a touchscreen (I've used the [https://www.amazon.de/Kuman-Resolution-Display-Protective-Raspberry/dp/B01FX7909Q](Kuman 3.5" resistive touchscreen "Amazon")) by a python program.
This project is aimed for schools, but might be used in other areas like universities or companies, too.
The PiPresenter is a project for "Jugend Forscht", a german science competition.

## Installation
Have a look at INSTALL.md.
I will probably make this installation easier in the future by providing a custom image.
